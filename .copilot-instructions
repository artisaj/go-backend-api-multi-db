Project guardrails for GitHub Copilot (GPT-5.1-Codex-Max):

- Use Portuguese for documentation and comments when helpful to the team.
- Favor Clean/Hexagonal Architecture with SOLID; respect layer boundaries (presentation -> application -> domain; infrastructure only via ports).
- Keep secrets out of code. Env vars only; no AWS Secrets Manager for now (add TODO if needed).
- Stack: Go 1.22+, chi para HTTP, zerolog para logging, mongo-driver para config store.
- Prefer Go idioms: small pure functions, context propagation, explicit errors.
- Default logging via structured logger; include correlation/request IDs.
- Caching: query-hash + entity-version keys; TTL + event-driven invalidation; avoid oversized payloads.
- Long-running queries: return query-id (job-id) immediately; client polls status endpoint.
- Telemetry from day one: traces, metrics (latency, cache hit/miss, job duration), logs with context.
